# Web project to visualise the price of Bitcoin for the past 30 days

## Project topic: create a website where you would be able to see an interactive Bitcoin price chart, also other cryptocurrencies will be added later on. 

### 1 milestone (August 25th):
- [X] created the base chart, with ability to hover over it and see the price for a certain date
### 2 milestone (September 5th):
- [ ] add the ability to see volume and market capitalisation of BTC for a certain day, if there is access to such data
- [ ] add a drop-down list, where one would be able to choose three other currencies to visualise: ETH, BNB and XRP, if there is access to such data
- [ ] add a tool tip, which moves as you hover over the chart, and shows the price for a certain date (and volume and marketcap, if there is access to such data)
- [ ] add the ability to choose the date range for which to show the price
