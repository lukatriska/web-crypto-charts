# Web project to visualise the price of Bitcoin for the past 30 days

## Project topic: create a website where you would be able to see an interactive Bitcoin price chart, also other cryptocurrencies will be added later on. 

### 1 milestone (August 25th):
- [X] created the base chart, with ability to hover over it and see the price for a certain date
### 2 milestone (September 5th):
- [X] add the ability to see volume (decided not to add ability to see market capitalisation of BTC, because it almost completely depends on the current price of BTC, so the graphs would be almost identical)
- [ ] add a drop-down list, where one would be able to choose three other currencies to visualise: ETH, BNB and XRP, if there is access to such data
- [ ] add a tool tip, which moves as you hover over the chart, and shows the price for a certain date (and volume and marketcap, if there is access to such data)
- [ ] add the ability to choose the date range for which to show the price
